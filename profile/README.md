## Welcome to House Of Iot ðŸ‘‹
Do you dislike having to use 5+ mobile apps to control your store bought smart devices?

Would you like to build your own smart devices and control them from one central interface?

# About
House of Iot is a collection of custom smart device automation software.

We provide a ["recipe-book"](https://github.com/House-of-IoT/Tutorials) of basic/general purpose smart devices for everyone who can't create custom devices.
Each device in our "recipe book" comes with a tutorial to setup the hardware and the matching software. 

We plan on having a never ending amount of 
premade devices so the average user can find everything they need for their home/life automation.

Everything is designed to have an easy setup, have been tested and  should work straight out of the box.

## The solved problems
- Central point of control for all devices.
    - We are tired of having to buy retail smart devices that each require a different mobile application to control.
    
- Personal hosting and no setup complications
    - HOI is designed to work without the need to setup a bunch of systems. 
    There is no need for any databases ,message brokers or any other enterprise requirements.
    - HOI software systems can be hosted anywhere!!
    
- Device relational control(Chain Controlling aka Relational Controlling)
    - Create a system of devices that can autonomously control each other's states.
    Check the [Chain Controlling](https://github.com/House-of-IoT/HOI-GeneralServer/blob/master/Docs/ChainControlling.MD) 
    documentation to learn more about this feature.
    
- Auto-Scheduling device actions
  - Won't have time to load the HOI interface and turn off your smart sprinkler system in 30 minutes? You can use the 
  [Auto Scheduling](https://github.com/House-of-IoT/HOI-GeneralServer/blob/master/Docs/AutoScheduling.MD) feature to
  schedule the action in advance.
