### What If I don't have the skills to design and implement custom systems/devices?
We provide a ["recipe-book"](https://github.com/House-of-IoT/Tutorials) of custom devices created by the community, this recipe book contains 
different types of devices that could come in handy in automating your home/life.

Every device in the recipe-book have custom peer reviewed tutorials for setting up the hardware and the software to run the system/device properly.
